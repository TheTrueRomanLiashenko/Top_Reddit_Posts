# Hello there!

This is my Android app project *Top Reddit Posts*. It's goal is to show top posts, listed in https://www.reddit.com/top.json .
It will support screen rotation, as well as show some information about top publications (such as author's name, thumbnails, comments counter etc.) and remember the last state of application, so there will be no problem in case if you accidentally closed the app.
Also, there will be implimented an ability to save thumbnails to the gallery!

# So bring a popcorn here and watch me trying my best to make my first Android app project successfull =)
